# 👋 Hi, I'm Oluwafisayomi

Currently a **Python Developer & Analyst**  but before that, I've been quite a few things...

🧬 **Anatomist by degree**,  
📊 **Analyst by self-learning**,   
💻 **Python Developer because I fell in love with the language**,  
and now I’m **transitioning into Software Engineering**.

I build **Python-based automation and data systems** that simplify how teams work with information.  

I’ve worked on projects involving **web scraping, API integrations, process automation**, and **data visualization**, using Python, JavaScript, Flourish, and many other tools.  

Currently, I’m expanding into **software engineering**, moving from automation and analytics to **to building interactive applications and user-focused interfaces** with a growing interest in **frontend engineering** because I love the **motion, interaction, and visuals** that make interfaces feel alive.
